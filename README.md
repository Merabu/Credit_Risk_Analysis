# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis
Jill commends you for all your hard work. Piece by piece, you’ve been building up your skills in data preparation, statistical reasoning, and machine learning. You are now ready to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, you’ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.

### purpose of this analysis.
For this project, I was asked by Jill to use imbalanced_learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling

The project included three techical analysis deliverables and written report.

Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk

Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk

Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis README.md
